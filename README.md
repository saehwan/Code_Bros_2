## Project Structuring Rules

### React

- React components should be functional, not class (see usage)

---

### Styling

- This project utilizes CSS modules.
- When importing SCSS files, use the following format:
  ```typescript
  import styles from "./[filename].module.scss";
  ```
  This ensures modularity of classNames.
- When referencing classNames, use them modularly:
  ```typescript
   <div className={styles.{yourClassName}}></div>
  ```
- Non-global styling should be encapsulated using SCSS nesting:
  ```SCSS
   .HomePage{
      display: flex;
      .HomePage-button{
         color: red;
      }
      .HomePage-whatever{
         color: blue;
         .something-insideOfWhatever{
            color: green;
         }
      }
   }
  ```
- For color consistency, theme colors should be defined in App.css and exported.

### Components

- All components (pages and sub-components) are in `src/components`.
- Component files should follow this naming convention:
  ```
  [component-name].component.tsx
  ```

### Redux

- This project leverages the Redux Toolkit.
- Global states should be separated into slices by category, if needed in the future. Refer to the codebase for usage examples.
